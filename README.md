# React-Motion with Create React App:

## What is React Motion?

React Motion makes animation easy using physics and allows you to animate the style prop of an element. 

It exports 3 main components, Motion, StaggeredMotion and TransitionMotion.


## Motion Component:
`<Motion />`

- Allows you to animate components within a page between style state.

Children passed to this component should be a function that should render a component. That function’s argument is the style that should be used to render that component at that point in time.

You can control the initial state with defaultStyle prop

The motion component requires a styles attribute as well as a function inbetween the component tags which feeds into this.props.children. 

**Required**
- style props
- Children passed to this component should be a function

**Optional**
- defaultStyle props
- onRest : A callback that fires when the animation comes to a rest.



## Transition Motion Component:
`<TransitionMotion />`

- Helps you to do mounting and unmounting animation.

Takes willLeave, willEnter, and styles as the attributes as well as a function inbetween the component tags which feeds into this.props.children. 

**Required**
- styles props 
- Children passed to this component should be a function

**Optional**
- defaultStyles props
- willLeave props : Styles that the component will be transitioned to before unmounting.
- didLeave props : Styles that will be removed after the finished transition.
- willEnter props : This is like the defaultStyle props, the initial style before transitioning. 



## Staggered Motion Component: 
`<StaggeredMotion />`

- Animates a collection of (fixed length) items whose values depend on each other, creating a natural, springy, "staggering" effect like so. This is preferred over hard-coding a delay for an array of Motions to achieve a similar (but less natural-looking) effect.

 **Required**
- styles props 
- Children passed to this component should be a function

**Optional**
- defaultStyles props



## Spring(): 

Used in conjunction with the components above. Specifies the how to animate to the destination value, e.g. spring(10, {stiffness: 100, damping: 20}) means "animate to value 10, with a spring of stiffness 100 and damping 20".

You have to pass in a number to the spring as the first parameter. React motion does some physics calculations or react motion magic.


## Spring Presets: 

  noWobble: {stiffness: 170, damping: 26}: The default, if nothing provided
  gentle: {stiffness: 120, damping: 14}
  wobbly: {stiffness: 180, damping: 12}
  stiff: {stiffness: 210, damping: 20}



# Installation: 

In your terminal run the following to install react-motion: 

`npm install --save react-motion`


### Definitions to know: 

*Arthimetic Progression:* A sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members is a constant. For example, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is an arithmetic progression with common difference 1. 

*Interpolate:* Insert (something of a different nature) into something else. "Illustrations were interpolated in the text"

*Damping:* Restraining of vibratory motion, such as mechanical oscillations, noise, and alternating electric currents, by dissipation of energy. Unless a child keeps pumping a swing, its motion dies down because of damping.

*Stiffness:* Is the rigidity of an object — the extent to which it resists deformation in response to an applied force. The complementary concept is flexibility or pliability: the more flexible an object is, the less stiff it is.
